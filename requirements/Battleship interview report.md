## Interview Transcript

**Q1: Can you explain the basic rules of Battleship?**  
**A:** Sure! Battleship is a 2-player guessing game. Each player places a fleet of ships on their grid without the other seeing. Players then take turns guessing coordinates on the opponent's grid, trying to locate and sink their ships. The first player to sink all of the opponent’s ships wins.

**Q2: What kinds of ships are typically used in the game?**  
**A:** There are 5 ships per player:  
- Carrier (5 spaces)  
- Battleship (4 spaces)  
- Cruiser (3 spaces)  
- Submarine (3 spaces)  
- Destroyer (2 spaces)  

Each ship takes up a specific number of grid squares and can be placed either horizontally or vertically.

**Q3: What are the most important gameplay actions?**  
**A:** The main actions include:  
- Placing ships on the grid  
- Calling out a coordinate on the opponent’s grid  
- Marking hits or misses  
- Tracking the status of your own ships  
- Winning the game when all enemy ships are sunk

**Q4: What features would make the game more user-friendly as a software version?**  
**A:** A clean grid layout, color indicators for hits/misses, simple drag-and-drop for placing ships, turn indicators, and maybe even a "fog of war" style animation would all improve the experience.

---

**Q5: What are some common challenges or frustrations players face?**  
**A:** Sometimes players forget where they've already guessed. Also, it can be tricky to track which ships are left. If the grid is too cluttered or the interface isn't responsive, it ruins the strategic feel.

•	**Q6: What would improve the digital experience of Battleship?**
**A:** Visual feedback, automatic ship tracking, and an onboarding tutorial would help.
